Monkeys in the garden
In a garden, trees are arranged in a circular fashion with an equal distance between two adjacent
trees. The height of trees may vary. Two monkeys live in that garden and they were very close to
each other. One day they quarreled due to some misunderstanding. None of them were ready to
leave the garden. But each one of them wants that if the other wants to meet him, it should take
maximum possible time to reach him, given that they both live in the same garden.
The conditions are that a monkey cannot directly jump from one tree to another. There are 30 trees
in the garden. If the height of a tree is H, a monkey can live at any height from 0 to H. Lets say he
lives at the height of K then it would take him K unit of time to climb down to the ground level.
Similarly, if a monkey wants to climb up to K height it would again take K unit of time. The time to
travel between two adjacent trees is 1 unit. A monkey can only travel in a circular fashion in the
garden because there is a pond at the center of the garden.
So the question is where should two monkeys live such that the traveling time between them is
maximum while choosing the shortest path between them in any direction clockwise or anticlockwise. You have to answer only the maximum traveling time.
Input Format
The first line consists of total number of trees (N) Each of the following N lines contains the height
of trees in a clockwise fashion.
